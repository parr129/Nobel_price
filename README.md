# 🏆 Nobel Prize Data Analysis (1901–2016)

## 📌 About This Project

Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the **Nobel Prize**—not just for the prestige or the gold medal, but for what it represents: **recognition of human excellence** in science, literature, and peace. This project is a data-driven journey into the stories and trends behind more than a century of Nobel Prize winners.

Using a dataset made publicly available by the **Nobel Foundation**, this analysis dives deep into:
- Gender and age disparities among winners
- Global representation and the rise of the United States
- Patterns of shared prizes and scientific collaboration
- Migration and brain drain in research institutions
- Repeat laureates like the legendary **Marie Curie**

## 📊 What’s Inside

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored:
- Which countries have dominated the Nobel Prize—and when did the USA take the lead?
- Are Nobel winners getting older over time?
- How has gender representation changed across categories?
- Which countries took the longest to win their first Nobel?
- How many prizes are shared today versus in the early 1900s?

### 🧠 Techniques Used:
- Data preprocessing with **pandas**
- Visualization with **seaborn** and **matplotlib**
- Time-series and categorical analysis
- Custom feature engineering (e.g., `decade`, `age_interval`, `is_shared`)
- Gender and migration analysis

### 📈 Notable Findings:
- **USA dominance** began around the 1930s and grew steadily—often via foreign-born laureates.
- **Only 49 out of 911 winners** were women as of 2016—a clear call for progress.
- **Winners are older now** than before, especially in Physics and Chemistry.
- **Collaboration is rising**, with a significant uptick in shared prizes.
- **Most countries** didn't win their first Nobel until after 1950—global recognition has expanded slowly.
